LPKF Boardmaster tutorial
=================================================

Main steps:

1. Panelizing in the Board Master.
2. Drilling
3. Milling
4. Routing

## Panelizing

The units are in inches. The board reference is against two holes which are used to hold the board down.

> Be sure to use a backing material to prevent bit damage!

You want a flat surface for milling (the copper board will be more flat) and a rough one for drilling/routing.


## Different

Go Home

Exchange position allows changing the bits.

## Drilling

Select "all+", press start.
Insert drill bits as you are asked for.

## Milling

Pick the sharpest Universal cutter, look under a microscope if you don't feel anything (when you touch them).

Change the backing material to a flat one.

Use the oil on the copper board to preserve the cutter bit.

Clean the excess of the copper from previous PCB milling to prevent damage to the plastic spacer that goes around the cutting bit as the machine will not retract it during the movement.

Make sure the bottom of that plastic spacer is free from dust.

Put the cutter in. Then attach the plastic spacer.

Move the head to the unmilled part of the board.

Find .15 gauge. Put it between the copper board and the plastic spacer. Hold down the tool head and release the bit lock. Do not put the gauge under the bit!

Choose MillingTop phase.

Select some area of the board to test the milling. Click the button to the left of + (green rectangles) to select the text, click plus and click start.

You want:
- a smooth trace (pass finger on top)
- make sure that the copper layer is milled through, but not too deep. (see pictures)

### Milling the bottom

Select the MillingBottom phase. Flip the copper board on the long edge (!). Now do the test run with a trace that runs to a pad. This way you will see if there is any misalignment of the copper board.

### Cutting outside

Use the bad backing material. Keep the board flipped.

Put the respective bit and make sure it does not go though the backing material!

Run the phase twice.

## After the milling

Use pencil erased to remove the remaining oil.
