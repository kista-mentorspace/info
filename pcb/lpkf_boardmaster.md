Milling machine tutorial
=================================================

Main steps:

1. Generate files in the CircuitCAM.
2. Panelizing in the Board Master.
3. Drilling
4. Milling
5. Routing

## CircuitCAM

## Panelizing

The units are in inches. The board reference is agains two holes which are used to hold the board down.

> Be sure to use a backing material to prevent bit damage!

You want a flat surface for milling (the copper board will be more flat) and a rough one for drilling/routing.
