LPKF Boardmaster tutorial
=================================================

Main steps:

1. Panelizing in the Board Master.
2. Drilling
3. Milling
4. Routing

## Panelizing

The units are in inches. The board reference is agains two holes which are used to hold the board down.

> Be sure to use a backing material to prevent bit damage!

You want a flat surface for milling (the copper board will be more flat) and a rough one for drilling/routing.
